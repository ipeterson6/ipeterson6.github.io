During my undergraduate and graduate degrees I mentored students in two different capacities: Peer Advising and KEYS Mentor.  

BIO5 KEYS Mentor
======

BIO5 Institute's KEYS (Keep Engaging Youth in Science) Research Internship Program: A unique summer opportunity for motivated Arizona high school students with a strong interest in bioscience, engineering, environmental health, data science and biostatistics to work with top University of Arizona faculty on research projects that address the world's greatest challenges.
As a mentor I was involved in teaching students Good Lab Practice (GLP) as well as how to follow Standard Operating Procedure (SOPs) documents and run their own cell culture experiments.
