**Abstract**

Tissue models have many applications across multiple scientific disciplines (Kanlayavattanakul, 2018); this model serves as a wound model using non-immortalized neonatal fibroblast cells.  Using this model, and the percentage of surface area of tissue culture well covered by adherent cells (confluence), we were able to model different conditions of skin health.  Undamaged “skin” was modeled using cells at 100% confluence, “skin” damage or “actively growing” was modeled using cells at 70% confluence, and recovery of a confluent monolayer after a mechanical scratch was also modeled.  This model lends itself to use in testing the morphologic impact of solid and liquid experimental condition, including elastin-like-polypeptide hydrogels and venom.  It also serves as the base template for cytotoxicity assays: 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) assays.  This method can be used in 12-, 24-, and 96-tissue culture well formats with a variety of experimental conditions, providing both qualitative and quantitative cytotoxicity data.
