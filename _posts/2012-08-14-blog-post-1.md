Abstract
======
Spinal cord injury (SCI) is characterized by an initial trauma followed by a progressive cascade of damage referred to as secondary injury. A hallmark of secondary injury is vascular disruption leading to vasoconstriction and decreased oxygen delivery, which directly reduces the ability of mitochondria to maintain homeostasis and leads to loss of ATP-dependent cellular functions, calcium overload, excitotoxicity, and oxidative stress, further exacerbating injury. Restoration of mitochondria dysfunction during the acute phases of secondary injury after SCI represents a potentially effective therapeutic strategy. This review discusses the past and present pharmacological options for the treatment of SCI as well as current research on mitochondria-targeted approaches. Increased antioxidant activity, inhibition of the mitochondrial permeability transition, alternate energy sources, and manipulation of mitochondrial morphology are among the strategies under investigation. Unfortunately, many of these tactics address single aspects of mitochondrial dysfunction, ultimately proving largely ineffective. Therefore, this review also examines the unexplored therapeutic efficacy of pharmacological enhancement of mitochondrial biogenesis, which has the potential to more comprehensively improve mitochondrial function after SCI.

SCI Pathology
======
SCI occurs in two phases: primary injury and secondary injury (Fig. 1). Primary injury refers to the immediate mechanical trauma to the spinal cord, which can be caused by compression, contusion, or distension; the most common of these is contusion (Sekhon and Fehlings, 2001; Baptiste and Fehlings, 2006). Complete spinal cord transection can occur but little to no functional recovery has been observed with pharmacological intervention alone in these instances; however, combinatorial therapies involving cellular transplantation have shown some promise (Coumans et al., 2001; Fouad et al., 2005). There exists the possibility for pharmacological intervention to aid in recovery after incomplete spinal cord transection, such as that generally observed after contusion, because the remaining intact tissue has the potential for repair (Hall and Springer, 2004). For the purposes of this review, we focus on incomplete transection.

Fig. 1: SCI pathology. The extent of damage after SCI is a combination of the initial trauma and secondary injury. The primary injury induces damage to the vasculature of the spinal cord, reducing local oxygen delivery, which decreases mitochondrial function and ATP synthesis and increases ROS production. In addition to mitochondrial dysfunction, hallmarks of secondary injury after SCI include neuronal cell death, axon demyelination and severing, microglia activation, and glial scar formation.
Within the first minutes to hours after injury, a secondary cascade is initiated, which can last for weeks or months and whose damaging effects are comparative to, if not greater than, that of the initial insult (Tanhoffer et al., 2007; Oyinbo, 2011). Consequences of secondary injury include progressive axon demyelination (Totoiu and Keirstead, 2005), neuronal cell death (Beattie et al., 2002; Anwar et al., 2016), microglia activation and inflammation (Qiao et al., 2010, 2015), glial scar formation (Shibuya et al., 2009), and mitochondrial dysfunction, all of which contribute to the progressive pathology. Because of the far-reaching effects of secondary injury, pharmacological therapeutics that seek to interrupt or control this stage of injury have the potential to improve neuron survival, allowing functional recovery (Hall and Sullivan, 2005; Oyinbo, 2011).

Over 25 mechanisms of secondary injury after SCI—as well as a temporal association of their occurrences, ranging from seconds (acute) to years (chronic) postinjury—have been identified (Oyinbo, 2011). For a more thorough discussion of secondary injury, see reviews by Tator and Fehlings (1991), Anderson and Hall (1993), Hall and Springer (2004), and Rowland et al. (2008). In brief, the initial primary trauma results in mechanical disruption of the spinal cord vasculature, leading to vasoconstriction and contributing to hemorrhage, edema, hypoperfusion, and ischemia (Baptiste and Fehlings, 2006; Graumann et al., 2011). Ischemia is considered a key mechanism of secondary injury, with the degree of functional loss being proportional to the degree of ischemia postinjury (Tator and Fehlings, 1991). Although angiogenesis does take place after SCI, the emerging vessels are often leaky and therefore do not allow for the necessary delivery of nutrients or removal of waste within the injured spinal cord (Kundi et al., 2013). Furthermore, the subsequent local decrease in oxygen delivery directly reduces the ability of mitochondria to maintain homeostatic function (Graumann et al., 2011; Kundi et al., 2013).

**Mitochondria after SCI**
Mitochondria are double-membraned organelles that, through oxidative phosphorylation, produce the majority of ATP for the cell. The outer mitochondrial membrane is a phospholipid bilayer containing voltage-dependent anion channels that, when open, allow the passage of small molecules, including ions, ATP, and ADP (Lemasters and Holmuhamedov, 2006; McEwen et al., 2011). The more complex inner membrane, while freely permeable to oxygen, water, and carbon dioxide, contains numerous tightly controlled channels, which regulate the electron transport chain (ETC) to maintain the necessary electrochemical gradient (∆ψ) for ATP synthesis (Saraste, 1999; Kinnally et al., 2011). Various reactive oxygen species (ROS) (e.g., superoxide anion, hydrogen peroxide, and hydroxyl radicals) can be formed when electrons leak from the ETC and combine with O2 in the mitochondrial matrix. Under control circumstances, endogenous antioxidant systems protect from ROS-induced toxicity (Candas and Li, 2014); however, disruption of the ETC under pathologic conditions can cause not only an energy deficit due to loss of ATP synthesis but also an increase in ROS production (Turrens, 2003) beyond the neutralizing capabilities of antioxidant systems.

Recently, understanding of the role of mitochondria within the central nervous system (CNS) has shifted from merely energy suppliers to essential contributors to both neural homeostasis and neurodegeneration (Dubinsky, 2005). Mitochondrial dysfunction after SCI has been suggested to be crucial for the proliferation of secondary injury and subsequent neuronal cell death (Sullivan et al., 2007). Neurons depend on stringent and efficient ATP-dependent regulation of various ions across the plasma membrane to maintain electrical homeostasis and to readily accommodate action potential conduction and the release/uptake of neurotransmitters. In addition, neurons have limited capacity to buffer oxidative stress (Adibhatla and Hatcher, 2010).

Given these large energy requirements and limited antioxidant defenses, neurons rely heavily on mitochondrial metabolism and ATP production and are susceptible to compromised mitochondria (Uttara et al., 2009; Moskowitz et al., 2010; Wang and Michaelis, 2010); even small mitochondrial defects can cause functional consequences and eventual pathology within the CNS (Dubinsky, 2005). Loss of mitochondrial function, such as that observed with secondary injury after SCI, results in the loss of ATP and inactivation of ATP-dependent ion pumps required for regulation of ion concentrations as well as reuptake of the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate. This dysfunction ultimately leads to excitotoxicity, calcium overload, and the eventual initiation of cell death cascades, all of which are hallmarks of SCI and further exacerbate injury in this self-propagating cycle (Choi and Rothman, 1990; Rowland et al., 2008; Oyinbo, 2011).

An early secondary event after SCI is depolarization and opening of voltage-dependent ion channels, leading to the release of neurotransmitters, including glutamate. Glutamate binds to glutamate receptors, opens corresponding ion channels, and results in accumulation of intracellular Ca2+ (Hall and Springer, 2004). Such ionic shifts can persist for days in injured tissue after SCI (Young and Koreh, 1986; Demediuk et al., 1990; LoPachin et al., 1999). Under control conditions, mitochondria can sequester and retain exogenous Ca2+ via an electrogenic carrier that facilitates transport across the inner membrane. Once Ca2+ is in the mitochondrial matrix, Ca2+ is stored in the form of inactive precipitates, which are eventually slowly released back into the cytosol (Crompton, 1999; Starkov, 2010). When Ca2+ is accumulated above a certain threshold, however, Ca2+ will trigger the opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP; Fig. 2).
The opening of the mPTP results in the loss of ∆ψ leading to the cessation of ATP synthesis and has been linked to necrosis and apoptosis after brain injury, neurodegenerative disorders, and SCI (Hirsch et al., 1998; Lemasters et al., 1998; Crompton, 1999; Friberg and Wieloch, 2002; Norenberg and Rao, 2007; Bezprozvanny, 2009; Pivovarova and Andrews, 2010). In addition, opening of the pore allows molecules and water into the mitochondria, causing the matrix to swell as it equilibrates with the cytosol and enlarging the inner membrane until the outer membrane ruptures, releasing accumulated Ca2+, ROS, and proapoptotic proteins (e.g., cytochrome c) into the cytosol, and promoting cell death (Sesso et al., 2004; McEwen et al., 2011). Importantly, Sullivan et al. (2004a) demonstrated that spinal cord mitochondria have a reduced Ca2+ threshold for opening of the mPTP than that of mitochondria isolated from the brain, further indicating the necessity of restoring mitochondrial homeostasis after SCI.

A consequence of the persistent ion shift during secondary injury is increased ROS. ROS are normal byproducts of mitochondrial function, but Ca2+ overload increases production in the CNS (Lewén and Hillered, 1998; Sullivan et al., 2004b). SCI induces a detrimental self-proliferating cycle of increased ROS production, leading to oxidative damage and additional ROS production, until pathologic levels are eventually reached. A particularly detrimental consequence of ROS is the formation of the powerful oxidant peroxynitrite (Violi et al., 1999). Development of peroxynitrite is increased after injury due to the increased concentration of superoxide and Ca2+-induced activation of nitric oxide synthase within the mitochondria (Bringold et al., 2000). Peroxynitrite can also trigger cell membrane lipid peroxidation (LP), protein carbonylation, and tyrosine nitration, damaging and impairing mitochondria and altering neuronal function after SCI (Violi et al., 1999; Sullivan et al., 2007; Hall et al., 2016).

LP results in additional free radicals, which propagate damage (Hall et al., 2016). LP can occur in blood vessels and neurons, which not only impairs neuronal and vascular integrity but also promotes ischemia and further contributes to secondary neuronal injury (Hall and Springer, 2004). Targeting reestablishment of mitochondrial homeostasis prior to damaging levels of ROS formation could potentially attenuate secondary injury after SCI. Temporal analysis revealed altered mitochondrial morphology beginning 2 hours after SCI, with increases in markers of oxidative damage beginning approximately 8 hours after injury and continuing until at least 24 hours after SCI (Sullivan et al., 2007; Jia et al., 2016). These data reveal the potential existence of an 8-hour window for therapeutic intervention to regain mitochondrial homeostasis after SCI.

Figure 2: Mechanisms to target mitochondrial homeostasis for the treatment of SCI. After SCI, cellular Ca2+ influx results in the opening of the mPTP and loss of the electrochemical gradient (∆ψ) necessary for ATP synthesis. mPTP opening also allows water and other molecules to move into the mitochondrial matrix, causing the matrix to swell and the outer membrane to rupture, releasing ROS, Ca2+, and proapoptotic proteins such as cytochrome c into the cytosol. CsA and its analog NIM811 act by binding to and inhibiting opening of the mPTP, preventing mitochondrial dysfunction. Biofuels such as ALC serve as alternate energy sources, allowing the citric acid cycle to continue despite the oxidative damage-induced inactivation of PDH. Antioxidants neutralize the activity of ROS through various mechanisms, contributing to enhanced mitochondrial function. Evidence indicates that mitochondrial fission is initiated shortly after injury, contributing to SCI-induced neuronal apoptosis. Compounds such as Mdivi-1, which inhibit Drp1, a major protein in mammalian mitochondrial fission, thereby prevent fission and decreased mitochondrial function. e−, electron; H+, hydrogen ion; H2O, water.

Conclusions
------

Targeting mitochondria for the treatment of SCI is not a novel idea. Mitochondrial dysfunction is a well characterized consequence of secondary injury after SCI and many promising experimental therapeutics enhance mitochondrial function, although generally through prevention via pretreatment or decreased injury through early administration after insult. Unfortunately, many of these agents remain to be assessed in humans. Of the agents that have been assessed, none have yet proven successful for the treatment of SCI. A plausible explanation for this is that in general, these compounds target singular facets of mitochondrial dysfunction, which may not be enough to successfully improve patient outcome. Alternative approaches enhancing several, if not all, aspects of mitochondrial function could prove more efficacious in accelerating recovery of SCI function. Combinatorial therapies, such as pharmacologically increasing antioxidant activity and decreasing mitochondrial fission simultaneously, could address multiple aspects of mitochondrial dysfunction after SCI. Such strategies, however, would undoubtedly require a great deal of refinement and consideration of multiple factors, including drug-drug interactions. Conversely, pharmacological augmentation of MB has the potential to more efficiently address this deficit. Therefore, the efficacy of mitochondrial biogenic compounds should be investigated for the therapeutic treatment of SCI.
