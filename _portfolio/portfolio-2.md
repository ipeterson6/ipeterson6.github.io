GFAP is a type III intermediate filament protein that is expressed in the cytoskeleton of Type 1 astrocytes in the spinal cord. In cells that are stressed or unhealthy, expressino of GFAP increases; Astrocyte cell surface antigen-2 is found on the surface of Type 1 astrocytes in the spinal cord under normal healthy conditions.  Because the cell in the below image is a Type 2 astrocyte in culture, it is expressing both GFAP (green channel) and ACSA-2 (red channel), the image presents as yellow. DAPI was used to visualize the nucleus.
